      <h2>Lend</h2>
      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>
      Lend module is used for collateralized lending-borrowing of assets on top of  the comdex chain. Any user can deposit their IBC-Assets in a listed cPool and start earning interest on the lent asset. Similarly they can open a borrow position for the lent asset of different IBC-Asset. The module contains transactions to open/close/edit the Lend {"&"} Borrow position. <br />
      If the user fails to maintain proper collateralization ratio, then his borrow position will be liquidated. After liquidation, creation of borrow position for the same pair is restricted and then liquidation and auction are handled by the respective modules.
      </p>
      
      <h4>STATE:</h4>
      <p>1. LendAsset</p>
      <pre>
        {`message LendAsset {
 uint64 lending_id 
 uint64 asset_id 
 uint64 pool_id 
 string owner 
 cosmos.base.v1beta1.Coin amount_in
 google.protobuf.Timestamp lending_time 
 string updated_amount_in
 string available_to_borrow 
 string reward_Accumulated 
 uint64 app_id
 string cpool_name
}`}
      </pre>

      <p>
        An user can come and lend their IBC-Assets in any of the pools according to their choice. The details for a particular asset lend is stored in this struct. Whenever a user deposits any IBC-Asset an equivalent amount of cToken is minted by the module and transferred to the user, which later is used to create a borrow position. Duplicate creation of lent positions for  IBC-Assets are prohibited in a specific pool. Available to borrow denotes the cToken balance of the user which is used to create a borrow position for different pairs available with the lent IBC-Asset in that pool.
      </p>

      <p>1. BorrowAsset:</p>
      <pre>
        {`message BorrowAsset {
 uint64 borrowing_id 
 uint64 lending_id 
 bool is_stable_borrow 
 uint64 pair_id 
 cosmos.base.v1beta1.Coin amount_in
 cosmos.base.v1beta1.Coin amount_out

 google.protobuf.Timestamp borrowing_time 
 string stable_borrow_rate 
 string updated_amount_out 
 string interest_Accumulated 
 string cpool_name 
}`}
      </pre>

      <p>
        A borrow position is created using cTokens which are available to borrow for a given lend position. The user first selects the lend position for which he wants to borrow. After selecting the lend position he will have the option to choose pairs from asset_pair_mappings data. The user selects the pair and then enters the cToken he wants to open a borrow position for. The maximum amount that can be borrowed is determined by the LTV of the lend IBC-Asset (from asset_rates_stats data). As soon as the user borrows some  amount Interest starts getting accumulated for his borrow position. Whenever the user closes his position he has to return Amount Borrowed plus the interest accumulated.
      </p>

      <p>1. Pool:</p>
      <pre>
        {`message Pool {
 uint64 pool_id

 string cpool_name 
 repeated AssetDataPoolMapping asset_data 
}
 
message AssetDataPoolMapping{
 uint64 asset_id 
 bool is_bridged 
}`}
      </pre>
      <p>
        A pool stores all the IBC-Assets in a specific module account. One pool contains One main Asset and two bridged assets. Lend and Borrow operations can be done either on one pool or different pools. In case of cross borrow (lent asset is on one pool and borrowed asset is from different pool) then the first_bridged_asset_id is used as a transition between different pools. Only if there is insufficient liquidity for the transaction from the first bridged asset, then the second bridged asset is used for transition into the second pool. <br />
        The LTV calculations of bridged assets are also taken into consideration while doing a cross borrow. The pools are initially bootstrapped from the fund_module_account transaction.

      <p>1. Extended_Pair:</p>

}`}
      </pre>
      <p>
        An Extended Pair defines the assetIn and assetOut according to the pools. This is used while creating a borrow transaction. It also has min_usd_value_left which determines the dust calculations in auction.

        This maps the asset In ID and Pool ID for a list of pair IDs <br />
        The user can only use the IDs listed if he wants to borrow against a lend position. These info are added through a base governance proposal.
