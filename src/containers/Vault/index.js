      <h2>Vault</h2>
      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>
        The Vault module holds the functionality to create / manage the CDP vaults users .The CDP vault creates an asset by locking up another listed asset as collateral.
      </p>
      <p>The prices of assets are tracked from oracles like Band Protocol.</p>
      <p>
        A liquidation event is triggered when the collateralization ratio of the position falls below the minimum threshold value (Liquidation Ratio) for a cAsset.
      </p>
      <p>Collateralization Ratio = (Value of collaterals locked up)/(Value of borrowed assets)</p>
      <p>
        The Module also offers Stable Mint functionality which is a global common vault for all users where the users can deposit / withdraw collateral for a  borrowed asset at 1 : 1 ratio. 
      </p>

      <h3>State</h3>
      <h4>Vault</h4>
      <p>A Vault represents a debt position owned by an address. It has a collateral type and records the debt that has been drawn and how much fees should be repaid.</p>

      <p>Only the owner can draw or repay the debt, but anyone can deposit collateral to a Vault. Deposits are scoped per address and are recorded separately in Deposit types. 
        <br />
        Depositors can withdraw their collateral provided it does not put the Vault below the liquidation ratio</p>

      <pre>
        {`message StableMintVault {
 				 string id 
 string amount_in 
 string amount_out
 uint64 app_id 
 				 uint64 extended_pair_vault_id }`}
      </pre>

      <h3>StableMint</h3>
      <p>A special type of global , ownerless vault for a vault type. The debt issued against the collateral is 1 : 1 in ratio of their dollar value .</p>
      <pre>
        {`message StableMintVault {
 				string id
